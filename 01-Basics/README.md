This section covers the fundamental building blocks of Java that I mastered during my early learning phase.

### Topics Covered:
* **Control Flow:** Implementation of `if-else` and `switch-case` structures.
* **Loops:** Mastery of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` iterations.
* **Operators:** Logical, arithmetic, and assignment operators.
* **Arrays:** Single and multi-dimensional array manipulations.
